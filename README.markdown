A few changes with my own motor layout, my own battery monitor, an RF detection monitor using the LED on the Receiver feeding an analog input and trigering the Failsafe routine if RF is lost and a seperate LED class file which flashes my LEDs slow -- battery < 10.6v  fast -- < 10.4v and RF lost/Failsafe veryFast
